This is an enhanced version of the BSPC utility. It is based on version
2.1h of the source code.

Restored features:

1. Restored the capability of decompiling a BSP file to an editable MAP
file

3. Restored the capability of updating the entity list in a BSP file
using entity definitions from a text file.

New features:

1. When MBSPC is used for converting BSP files to MAP files, the correct
texture name is written for every brush side (but see Note 1.).

2. Added a new switch '-entlist'. This will produce a list of entity
definitions from a BSP file in an editable ASCII text file.

3. Added a new switch '-texinfo'. If you specify this switch, MBSPC writes
a simple ASCII text file (extension '.txi') containing the list of textures
and models (i.e. all shaders) used by in the BSP file specified.

Note 1.
-------
This new feature works only with Q3A BSP files (at present).

Texture alignment info (shift, scale, rotation) is not written to the
MAP file produced. It is not trivial to obtain this info from the BSP, and
I did not need it when I coded this modification, sorry. If you need this
functionality, add the necessary code.
