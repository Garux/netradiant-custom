/*QUAKED _skybox (0.77 0.88 1.0) (-4 -4 -4) (4 4 4) 
Compiler-only entity that specifies a the origin of a sky box (a wholly contained, separate area of the map), similar to some games' portal skies. When compiled with Q3Map2, the sky box surfaces will be visible from any place where sky is normally visible. It will cast shadows on the normal parts of the map, and can be used with cloud layers and other effects. As it is compiler-only, it can't "scale up" entities in its box.
To use this, carve a small box in some larger structure on your map, place this entity inside that box hole, and make a small version on what should be seen in the sky there.
-------- KEYS --------
angle: rotation angle of the sky surfaces.
angles: Individual control of PITCH, YAW, and ROLL (default 0 0 0).
_scale: scaling factor (default 64), good values are between 50 and 300, depending on the map.

/*QUAKED func_door (0 .5 .8) ? START_OPEN - DOOR_DONT_LINK - - TOGGLE
Normal sliding door entity. By default, the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage is inflicted to it.

-------- KEYS --------
message: is printed when the door is touched if it is a trigger door and it hasn't been fired yet, or death message if dmg is set

Normal rotating door entity that opens by rotating around an axis (default: Z). Use an origin brush to specify the rotation axis.
By default, the door will activate when player walks close to it or when damage is inflicted to it.
If DOOR_DONT_LINK is not set, the door will be linked with all doors it touches.
BIDIR makes the door work bidirectional, so that the opening direction is always away from the requestor.
The usage of bidirectional doors requires two manually instantiated triggers (trigger_multiple), the one to open it in the other direction
must have set trigger_reverse to 1.
BIDIR_IN_DOWN will the door prevent from reopening while closing if it is triggered from the other side.
-------- KEYS --------
message: is printed when the door is touched if it is a trigger door and it hasn't been fired yet, or death message if dmg is set

/*QUAKED func_group (0 .5 .8) ? 
This is not an entity as such. It is strictly an editor utility to group world brushes and patches together for convenience (selecting, moving, copying, etc). You cannot group entities with this.
-------- Q3MAP2 KEYS --------
_lightmapscale: light map resolution factor
_castshadows: Allows per-entity control over shadow casting. Defaults to 0 on entities, 1 on world. 0 = no shadow casting. 1 = cast shadows on world. > 1 = cast shadows on entities with _rs (or _receiveshadows) with the corresponding value, AND world. Negative values imply same, but DO NOT cast shadows on world.
_receiveshadows: Allows per-entity control over shadow reception. Defaults to 1 on everything (world shadows). 0 = receives NO shadows. > 1 = receive shadows only from corresponding keyed entities (see above) and world. < 1 = receive shadows ONLY from corresponding keyed entities.

/*QUAKED func_plat (0 .5 .8) ? - - CRUSH
Rising platform the player can ride to reach higher places. Plats must always be drawn in the raised position, so they will operate and be lighted correctly but they spawn in the lowered position. The plat will stay in the raised position until the player steps off.
-------- KEYS --------
speed: determines how fast the plat moves (default 150).
lip: lip remaining at end of move (default 16). Has no effect if "height" is set.
height: if set, this will determine the total amount of vertical travel of the plat.
dmg: damage to inflict on player when he blocks operation of plat. Plat will reverse direction when blocked.
targetname: if set, the trigger that points to this will lower the plat each time it fires. The plat lowers and lifts someone up later.
sounds: 2 for alternate sound set, -1 for silence, or use the fields below
sound1: platform starts moving sound
sound2: platform stop sound
message: kill message, when someone gets killed by this plat
message2: death message when someone gets pushed into this (default: "was thrown into a world of hurt by"). The # character is replaced by the attacker name if present (and it instead does not get appended to the end)
-------- SPAWNFLAGS --------
CRUSH: crush players hit by the platform instantly
-------- NOTES --------
By default, the total amount of vertical travel of a platform is implicitly determined by the overall vertical size of the brushes of which it's made minus the lip value. But if the "height" key is used, then the total amount of vertical travel of the plat will be exactly that value regardless of the shape and size of the plat and regardless of the value of the "lip" key. Using the "height" key is the best method for any kind of platforms and the only possible one for thin plats which need to travel vertical distances many times their own thickness. Setting the origin key is simply an alternate method to using an origin brush. When using the model2 key, the origin point of the model will correspond to the origin point defined by either the origin brush or the origin coordinate value.

Non-displayed point light source. The -pointscale and -scale arguments to Q3Map2 affect the brightness of these lights. The -skyscale argument affects brightness of entity sun lights.
Maximum intensity (in a radius 16 sphere around the light): regular lights have light/256, linear lights have light/8000-16*fade.
Falloff radius to a negligible light amount: regular lights have light have 16*sqrt(light), linear lights have light/(fade*8000).

/*QUAKED trigger_impulse (.5 .5 .5) ? 
An accelerator/dampener/wind field.
Can be used in two ways:
"dampener field": just set strength to a value from 0 to 1. Entering the field will slow down to this factor.
"accelerator field": just set strength to a value from 1 to infinity. Entering the field will accelerate by this factor.
"wind field": set strength to the amount of velocity to add per second, and target a target_position. The field will apply force in the direction from its own origin to the target (use an origin brush to specify its own origin, or this will fail) when touched.
"gravity field": set strength to the amount of velocity to add per second at the center, and set radius to the radius of the field. Set falloff to the desired falloff characteristics.
-------- KEYS --------
target: "wind field": points to the target_position to which the player will get pushed.
strength: "wind field", "gravity field": amount of force per second to apply. "dampener/accelerator field": slowdown/speedup factor.

Q3A "target" way: put the target_position at the apex of the jump, and hope the player will land at the right spot. Good luck.

Spawns or modifies an entity when triggered.
The entity field list is a single string of the form:

The special "field" name $ calls a void(void) function, for example a spawn function.
Special function names available are _setmodel and _setsize.
Field values can use various variable replacements:
$E
$E.field
$E.field+offset
$E.field+offset+randomoffset
where "E" can be self, activator, target (the entity being created/modified) and pusher.
Example is a Mario-style question mark block which could throw a new weapon_nex when activated like this:

Solid entity that oscillates according to a sum of sine waves.
-------- KEYS --------
speed: amount of time in seconds for one complete oscillation cycle in the base frequency (default 4).
height: sets the amount of travel of the oscillation movement (default 32). 
phase: sets the start offset of the oscillation cycle. Values must be 0 < phase < 1. Any integer phase value is the same as no offset (default 0).
